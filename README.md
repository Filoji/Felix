## How to adopt Felix:

If you want to adopt _Felix_, you will need to create a small house for him.  
Because he can grow up, we recommand you to copy this project inside of a directory only used for Git project.  
Next, you will need to create a symbolic link from the `felix` program to your Path.  
For exemple, you can create a directory, add it to the Path, and create your link here.  
So you can take care of Felix and let him grow up without need to change everytime your configs.
